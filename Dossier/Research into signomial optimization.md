# Research into signomial optimization
## Date modified: 2021-11-21
### Objectives
1. Find the current best convergences result:
	1. That is the the theorem with the most general conditions for convergence of a hierarchy of SAGE-relaxations of a given signomial program.
	2. Known rates of convergence.
2. Create a list of applications of signomial optimization with associated references.
3. Find a minimal working example of numerical code for signomial optimization.

### Rank/Reason/Summarize

1. [[#^CS14]] This is the paper that started signomial interest  in N&O
	1. Lemma linking AM-GM Expo and relative entropy
	2. Hierarchies (unconstrained (3.3) and constrained (3.6))
	3. Convergence results (unconstrained (Theorem 4.1) and constrained (Theorem 4.2)) Can make pictures based on **extremal exponents**
	4. Dual perspective ?
	5. Collection of why/when sig. opt. is better than POP (discussion section). 
2. ** [[#^DM21]]** Recommended my both M. and L. 
	1. Contains the strongest Positivstellensatz that I know of
	2. Compares to other Pos-stel.
	3. Many nice examples and picture ideas
	4. Tight little proof of NP hardness for sig. opt.
	5. Lots of useful theory.
3. [[#^M21 ]] Hinted by M. and is a thesis on the topic
4. [[#^WJYP20 ]]  Cited a lot by [[#^DM21]]
5. [[#^CS16 ]] Has applications in the title.
6. [[#^MNT20 ]] Murray bias and content could be contained in thesis
7. [[#^NMC20 ]] Murray bias and content could be contained in thesis
8. [[#^NMC20b ]] Murray bias and content could be contained in thesis
10. [[#^KNT20]] Temporal bias
11. [[#^DT21]]
12. [[#^DIW17]]
13. [[#^IW16]]
14. [[#^X14]]
15. [[#^DPZ68 ]] Geometric programming is a specific instance of sig. opt.
16. [[#^C05 ]] Useful only for a singe application example
17. [[#^GIT14 ]] looks tangential
18. [[ ^MHR19]]
19. [[#^MF97]] Useful only for a singe application example
20. [[#^^SW96]]  Useful only for a singe application example

#### Applications list:
- From [[#^CS14]]
	- resource allocation in networks [[#^C05 ]] (This looks a bit heavy but there is stuff on page 74)
	- control problems involving chemical processes  [[#^MF97]]  4.2 Alkylation process design
	- spatial frame design [33],  [https://doi.org/10.1016/S0045-7825(96)01097-3]
	- and certain nonlinear flow problems in graphs [21]. [E. L. Peterson, Geometric programming, SIAM Rev., 18 (1976), pp. 1â€“51]()
- From [[#^DM21]] 
	- Lukas Wachter, Orcun Karaca, Georgios Darivianakis, and Themistoklis Charalambous
	-  chemical reaction networks and biochemical networks [[ ^MHR19]]
	-  And a few more but I think this will have to suffice for now.
