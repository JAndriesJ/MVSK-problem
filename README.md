# Mean-Variance-Skewness-Kurtosis (MVSK) optimization 
![[MVSK.png]]

## Introduction 
This repository provides polynomial optimization tools for the solving of the MVSK problem from portfolio optimization.
It follows the general paradigm of moment based hierarchies of approximations for polynomial optimization problems.
This code was written as part of my [POEMA](http://poema-network.eu/) secondment at [NAG](https://www.nag.com/)
For details of the mathematics see [arXiv paper](url)

## How to install
The code should be stand alone:
git clone ....
Pkg.instantiate()
ready to roll


## How to use
The sole purpose of this code is the computation of the the following polynomial optimization problem (POP)
$$
the POP formulation
$$
Since POPs are NP hard to solve in general we resort to approximations. We use the moment based hierarchy of approximations:
$$
the moment hierarchy

Where the following are user set parameters:
- Par 1
- Par 2
- Par 3
